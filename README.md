# pricingPanelCSSExercise
Practicing my CSS knowledge
The purpose of this activity is to practice my newly acquired knowledge of FLexbox and its properties.
Flex- Directiom, Justify-Content, Align-item
Display: Block and inline-Block

I also became more comfortable with padding and margins as well as other properties like Font-weight, letter-spacing, line-height as well as media queries.

I think i have to practice it more and also do more exercises.
